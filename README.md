# System Health Assistant

## What is this?
A read-only system health assistant that helps non-technical users understand what’s happening on their computer without risking data loss.
An application that is easy to use for any user and works even on older or low-end hardware.

## Why does it exist?
Elderly and non-technical users often struggle with system issues, while existing tools are either too complicated or too intrusive. This project prioritizes data safety, clear explanations, and trust.

## Problem
- System diagnostic tools assume the user understands operating system concepts and computer jargon
- Automatic “fix” tools can cause irreversible damage or data loss
- Non-technical users lack clear explanations of issues and simple steps to a solution

## Constraints
- Read-only diagnostics (no automatic system changes)
- Explanations must be easy to understand for users unfamiliar with computer terms
- Must run on low-end hardware
- Minimal performance impact
